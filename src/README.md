1. Create React components: Create functional React components using component composition and nesting.
2. Manage states with hooks: Implement React Hooks, specifically the useState and useEffect hooks. You will use hooks to manage component-level state and control the visibility of elements.
3. Integrate Redux: Integrate Redux within an application using Redux concepts like actions, reducers, and the store.
4. Render dynamic data: Dynamically render data fetched from an array of objects into the UI. You will map over arrays to generate lists of components.
5. Handle events using conditional rendering: Handle user events such as button selection and trigger corresponding actions.
